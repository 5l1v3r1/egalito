Egalito is a binary rewriting framework that combines static and dynamic
techniques to handle any input binary. It leverages compiler metadata
whenever possible to get accurate disassembly of code, and defers to runtime
otherwise. Egalito is meant to be used to implement new security features.

Egalito also focuses on being able to rewrite all code in a target program,
including itself. This is important for implementing binary-level security
schemes since the attacker can easily target the instrumentation framework
if it is undefended.

Egalito supports x86_64 and aarch64, with upcoming support for 32-bit arm.
