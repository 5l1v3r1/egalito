Egalito is a binary rewriting framework that focuses on being able to rewrite
all code in a target program, including itself. This is important for
implementing binary-level security schemes since the attacker can easily
target the instrumentation framework if it is undefended.

To test, run
    $ cd src ; make
    $ make -C test
    $ ./loader test/hello
