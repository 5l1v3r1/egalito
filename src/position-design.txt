Position designs.

0). No caching. SubsequentPosition is very slow.

1). get() function returns cached value; after moving a Chunk, need to
    call recalculate() on all Chunks in the same Function. Cannot have
    position dependencies other than "depends on previous child".

2). Each position stores a generation, and any get() call checks this
    generation against that of its dependencies. Can have arbitrary
    acyclic dependencies. Takes more space to store generations.
    Problem: checking dependencies walks the chunk tree backwards.
